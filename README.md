# bash shell scripts to act as a Fritz!Box client 

This is meant as a bare bones set of scripts to help me communicating with my own Fritz!Box. If they are useful for others: great!

When not: There are much more fancy clients in other languages, like these:

- PHP (last update 2013-11): <https://github.com/nihunde/FritzClient>
- C++ (last update 2015-03): <https://github.com/jowi24/kfritz>
- C++ (last update 2015-01): <https://github.com/jowi24/vdr-fritz>
- Python (last update: 2014-02): <https://github.com/exhuma/fritzclient>
- C++ (lastupdate 2014-02): <https://github.com/jowi24/libfritzpp>

Note: the dates are at the time of writing this.

Base repository is at <https://github.com/jpluimers/bash-fritzclient.git>

Ensure there is a `bash-fritzclient.config` in the parent directory.
